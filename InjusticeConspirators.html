                <blockquote> <strong>On August 15, 2015 </strong>&nbsp;Seven officers from the Antioch Polic Department stormed into the long time home of Michael Kitterman while he slept, pulled him from his home, and dragged him away naked in view of his neighbors and family while they searched his modest home looking for anything they could find to incriminate him. What police lacked was probable cause for suspicion. Michael had not had so much as a parking ticket in his home town and was never mentioned in any search warrant or any affidavit of probable cause for suspicion. Even when the words of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution were quite clear as to the law, nearly everyone empowered with interpreting those laws treated the law with contempt during the process to procesecute Michael Kitterman. Even his own appointed attorney defied the law when she ordered police to search her client's property being held for any signs of illegal activity, and later arranged the case to be held in the courtroom of a judge friend who she colluded with in her refusal to be fired by her client. On the day of the important hearing that would decide Michael's fate, his appointed attorney sat at the defense table and refused to utter a single word or cross examine any police officer who took the stand to change their original stories. The trial was over in one swoop that resembled a touchdown pass from Montana to Rice, and Michael was convicted of each charge after the jury deliberated for less than two minutes. Michael also lost his appeal and his civil case against his attorney who holds immunity. The case is now under review by the California Supreme Court.&nbsp;<br><br><span style="font-style: normal;"><br>Stephen Hyde - July 2018</span></blockquote>
