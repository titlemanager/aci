        <div class="media-container-row">
            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><br></p><p>The American Citizens Institute exists as a vehicle for those who shall work to ensure a fair, suitable, and orderly balance between individual freedoms, and the imposition of government social control. Guided by principles of the highest integrity and worth, all work shall pay duty to matters of cooperation, fairness, proportion, and benefit. It is with unity and knowledge that this institute hopes to foster the concepts that will provide a foundation on which lives can be saved.</p><p><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">I.	We are independent
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">American Citizen Institute has no division or lines drawn. We are not aligned with any organization, race, or outside cause. We have no targeted opposition, nor do we harbor any hidden agendas. Our approach and perception is placed outside of any specific culture, state, political alliance, or group. We keep a universal conscience toward the goodwill for all people.   
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">II.	We are peaceful
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">American Citizen Institute is opposed to aggression, force, or violence or any illegal means being used by anyone, even when the ultimate intent is for an honorable purpose. We have no opposition or enemy. We are servants for peace and do not protest, complain, or point fingers. We exist merely to work alongside and subservient to all of those closely tied to the problems that we are working to resolve. We think killing is avoidable in almost all situations. We place human lives above all things.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">III.	We are human
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">American Citizen Institute knows that as human beings our reasoning is a process, and that human perfection is impossible. Through the realization that within us we have challenges of our own, and by working to overcome those challenges, we think is the best way to come to qualified conclusions and solutions. Some of the ways we do this is by adhering to a neutral, fair, and universal perspective, thinking back as well as ahead, and by using empathy and tolerance as our guide. We keep goodwill and compassion at the forefront of our intentions. 
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">&nbsp;IV.	We are loving
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">American Citizen Institute regards love as a necessary two-way ingredient for life that requires tolerant, empathetic, and compassionate action and interactivity. We renounce hatred and all other forms of excessive fear.  
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">V.  	We are transparent
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">American Citizen Institute believes that freedom of information promotes progress, just as the concealment of the truth is restrictive. We support the carefully managed exchange of information for solidarity and the uniting of communities. 
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">VI.	We are free
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">American Citizen Institute holds that reservation of basic individual freedoms must be protected so that individuality of life may thrive. We believe that a universally-desired safe and harmonious community can only exist under equal protections under the rule of law, and that any deviation of that rule, or tolerance for deviation, whether by any person or institution, can only serve as a disruption of that peace.    
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"><br></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(7, 59, 76); font-size: 1.2rem;">These are the guiding values and principles of the American Citizens Institute</span><strong>.&nbsp;</strong><br></p><div><div><strong><br></strong></div><div><strong><br></strong></div></div><p></p></div>

                    Real World Issues</h2>
                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-5">
                    The following &nbsp;is a list of important issues that currently challenge the peace, happiness, and the very lives of millions of our country's citizens. Yet there has been a general resistence to any significant acceptance of responsibility for them. &nbsp;Instead, a growing lack of compassion by those unaffected runs parallel to the surrmounting risk and suffering by those inflicted by the symptoms of these issues. While American Citizens Institute has only limited resources that are currently targeting other specific needs, these are issues that we still hold with great concern and importance. In our committment toward saving lives, it is our desire to someday have the ability to do more to address these grave matters. For now, the least we can do is recognize them.</h3>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>MENTAL HEALTH&nbsp;</strong>- There are tens of millions of citizens who are severely menatlly ill in the United States. Nearly all of them are without treatment, a home, or any case management assistance. Our jails are populated with these individuals whose only crime is their illness. They are subject to further cruelty and suffering within these institutions by their fellow inmates who regard them as they do sex offenders due to their own lack of understanding. The mentally ill do not receive the same protection as sex offenders and are openly ridiculed, beaten, and even murdered as jail staff with an equal lack of understanding turn a blind eye to their suffering.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>DRUG ABUSE</strong>&nbsp;- There is but one known care program available to drug addicts in our country. Its effectiveness is unknown and unmonitored. It is one that is home derived, homegrown, and home schooled. The entire self help program is contained in just one book written eighty years ago by a man who recieved not one unit of education on the matter, and who was simply a sufferer of alcoholism himself. The program receives no public funding, has no success tracking, and of course is not groomed for each individual. Meanwhile, as an opioid epidemic is rising in our country, and drug overdose is a leading cause of death, that book remains as the single existing effort made to address the issue and the only real treatment option available for any American that becomes dependent on any drug or alcohol. While it may be effective and enough for a very small percentage of the population, it is not a viable nor legitimate effort by our society of addressing the issue in any measured fashion. There is a major denial of responsibility for the unnecessary deaths that are occurring to our brothers, our sisters, and our children. There is a complete failure to properly assess and address this matter that affects a substantial portion of our citizens. &nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>FOREIGN POLICY</strong>&nbsp;- Our industrial military complex costs an estimated three trillion dollars each year. Most of that money is spent on foreign aggressions against innocent people in volation of international law and without congressional approval. The result is the death of men, women, and children who have committed no foul against America or Americans. <a href="https://mobirise.com/" class="text-info">Twenty million innocent people have died as part of the United States foreign policy since World War II.&nbsp;</a></li>
