            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><strong>Thank you for deciding to visit us.  </strong>American Citizens Institute would like to extend a warm and gracious welcome to you. Let me get right to the point and let you know what we are about.
</p><p>
<strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is little deterrent, little oversight, and little consequence when the United States government abuses its power in violation of international or domestic law. This fact is not diminished when that violation results in the death of a human being, or when it occurs unecessarily during routine American  law enforcement procedures. 
</p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our founding fathers recognized the need to limit the powers of government. Men have long known that unrestrained power will lead to at least some level of corruption. When there is no deterent or consequence, some men are bound to act evil. This fact is demonstrated by the countless men, women, and children who are slaughtered each year in America at the hands of those who are sworn to protect them.
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"></span><br><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;"></span></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One must ask why is the officer-involved-shooting epidemic is growing in America. We have studied the problem and have discovered that there are two reasons. One is the lack of police oversight. The other is a misguided sense of selfishness by a fearful and uninformed nation whose primary concern within the issue is their fully invested reliance on police for their own personal security.  The latter reason being responsible for the first.   
</p><p><strong></strong><br><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am the founder of a new non-profit organization that has some rather bold ambitions. I am attempting to assemble a team of extraordinary people for the purpose of something extraordinary. The main priority in my life is to do my best to effect the reduction of the number of deaths that occur at the hands of the law enforcement in America. This requires that I make a solicitation to you for your assistance. I believe that together we could pave the way for the creation of a new department of the federal government that would have the sole purpose of providing oversight for the organizations that are responsible for social control in America. Under this oversight I envision improved law enforcement efficiency, increased protection of individual liberties, and a reduction in the occurrences of unnecessary deaths.
 There are also many other ways we plan to serve the community.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My proposed body of governance would bear little resemblance to any department of government to date. This division would be infused with mechanisms designed specifically to prevent corruption or exploitation. It would possess real enforcement power and would be backed by the consent of the people in order to carry out the genuine will of an informed American citizenry. There would be no opportunity for tyrannical, financial, or political exploitation, as the entire development and operating of this entity would be designed to be resistant to corruption or influence and made to adhere entirely to a true democratic process.
</p><p><strong>
</strong><strong></strong></p><p><strong>
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Such an undertaking would stand little chance of success by conventional means because the conventional means in place lacks integrity. I believe that I may have found a way that promises to make such a new division of government a reality. You are being solicited because you are passionate about human rights, or you are knowledgeable about law enforcement. You have demonstrated a natural care and concern for your fellow man that compels you to make personal sacrifices for the benefit of others. You have a respect for the U.S. constitution and the principles for which it stands. You recognize and understand the hypocrisy of the American government. You show little fear in denouncing the evils of our government, and you show courage toward taking corrective actions to serve the publicy. You belong to a group of individuals who appear best suited and most capable of contributing to the successful work of creating a whole new department of government. You are what makes such a bold idea possible. You have been carefully identified as an important necessary ingredient to a new recipe. You have been chosen to be invited to become a part of an unprecedented action group. A sort of â€˜democracy dream team' if you will.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all exceptional people, you are very busy and it would be hard for you to imagine fitting any additional responsibilities, or sacrifices into your already demanding schedule. The American Citizens Institute is being built and designed to accommodate your convenience so that your contribution can be made effectively with the least intrusion or demand put upon you personally. We will manage the leg work so that you can simply exercise your gift of higher reasoning. As the founder of this organization I accept this responsibility personally.
</p><p><strong></strong><br><strong></strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally, you would need more time, and more information before you would consider committing to being on the board of this particular cause. By confirming your interest, you will not be held to commit to this project. Nor does it necessarily mean that you believe in the chance of success for this cause. When you click confirm, it only indicates that you support the notion that the people of America are in need of some type of solution or assistance that is radical in change. That you agree that it is only through well thought out plans and carefully executed policies that the current challenges can be overcome. That you do believe that together we can make a difference. That you believe America deserves better for herself where life has the highest value, the rule of law prevails, and where all people can be granted a fair chance at life and happiness.
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time,
</p><p>
</p><p>Michael Kitterman
