</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Meetings and actions of all committees shall be governed by, and held and taken in accordance with, the provisions of Article 5 - Board of Directors of these bylaws concerning meetings and actions of the directors, with such changes in the context of those bylaws as are necessary to substitute the committee and its members for the Board of Directors and its members, except that the time for regular meetings of committees may be determined either by resolution of the Board of Directors or by resolution of the committee. Special meetings of committees may also be called by resolution of the Board of Directors. Notice of special meetings of committees shall also be given to any and all alternate members, who shall have the right to attend all meetings of the committee. Minutes shall be kept of each meeting of any committee and shall be filed with the Corporation/Organization records. The Board of Directors may adopt rules not consistent with the provisions of these bylaws for the governance of any committee.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>If a director relies on information prepared by a committee of the Board on which the director does not serve, the committee must be composed exclusively of any or any combination of (a) directors, (b) directors or employees of the Corporation/Organization whom the director believes to be reliable and competent in the matters presented, or (c) counsel, independent accountants, or other persons as to matters which the director believes to be within that person's professional or expert competence.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br>Executive Committee
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Pursuant to Article 7 - Committee of Directors, the Board may appoint an Executive Committee composed of a minimum of 3 directors, one of whom shall be the Chair of the Board of the Board and another shall be either the Secretary, or the Treasurer, to serve on the Executive Committee of the Board. The Executive Committee, unless limited in a resolution of the Board, shall have and may exercise all the authority of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation/Organization between meetings of the Board, provided, however, that the Executive Committee shall not have the authority of the Board in reference to those matters enumerated in Article 7 - Committee of Directors. The Secretary of the Corporation/Organization shall send to each director a summary report of the business conducted in any meeting of the Executive Committee.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br>ARTICLE 8 - STANDARD OF CARE
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>General
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>A director shall perform all the duties of a director, including, but not limited to, duties as a member of any committee of the Board on which the director may serve, in such a manner as the director deems to be in the best interest of the Corporation/Organization and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinary, prudent, and reasonable person in a similar situation may exercise under similar circumstances.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>In the performance of the duties of a director, a director shall be entitled to rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, in each
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>case prepared or presented by:
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>One or more officers or employees of the Corporation/Organization whom the director deems to be reliable and competent in the matters presented;
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Counsel, independent accountants, or other persons, as to the matters which the director deems to be within such person's professional or expert competence; or
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>A committee of the Board upon which the director does not serve, as to matters within its designated authority, which committee the director deems to merit confidence,
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>so long as in any such case the director acts in good faith, after reasonable inquiry when the need may be indicated by the circumstances, and without knowledge that would cause such reliance to be unwarranted.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Except as herein provided in Article 8 - Standard of Care, any person who performs the duties of a director in accordance with the above shall have no liability based upon any failure or alleged failure to discharge that person's obligations as a director, including, without limitation of the following, any actions or omissions which exceed or defeat a public or charitable purpose to which the Corporation/Organization, or assets held by it, are dedicated.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Loans
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Corporation/Organization shall not make any loan of money or property to, or guarantee the obligation of, any director or officer, unless approved by the California Attorney General; provided, however, that the Corporation/Organization may advance money to a director or officer of the Corporation/Organization or any subsidiary for expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in the performance of the duties of such officer or director so long as such individual would be entitled to be reimbursed for such expenses absent that advance.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Conflict of Interest
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>The purpose of the Conflict of Interest policy is to protect the Corporation/Organization's interest when it is contemplating entering into a transaction or arrangement that might benefit the private interest of one of its officers or directors, or that might otherwise result in a possible excess benefit transaction. This policy is intended to supplement but not replace any applicable state and federal laws governing conflict of interest applicable to nonprofit and charitable corporations/organizations and is not intended as an exclusive statement of responsibilities.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Restriction on Interested Directors
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Not more than 60% (percent) of the persons serving on the Board of Directors at any time may be interested persons. An interested person is (1) any person currently being compensated by the Corporation/Organization for services rendered to it within the previous twelve (12) months, whether as a full-time or part-time employee, independent contractor, or otherwise, excluding any reasonable compensation paid to a director; and (2) any brother, sister, parent, ancestor, descendent, spouse, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, son-in-law, mother-in-law, or father-in-law of any such person. However, any violation of the provisions of this section shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any transaction entered into by the interested person.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Duty to Disclose
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>In connection with any actual or possible conflict of interest, an interested person must disclose the existence of the financial interest and be given the opportunity to disclose all material facts to the directors who are considering the proposed transaction or arrangement.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Establishing a Conflict of Interest
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>After the disclosure of the financial interest and all material facts, and after any discussion with the interested person, the interested person shall leave the Board meeting while the potential conflict of interest is discussed and voted upon. The remaining Board members shall decide if a conflict of interest exists.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Addressing a Conflict of Interest
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>In the event that the Board should establish that a proposed transaction or arrangement establishes a conflict of interest, the Board shall then proceed with the following actions:
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Any interested person may render a request or report at the Board meeting, but upon completion of said request or report the individual shall be excused while the Board discusses the information and/or material presented and then votes on the transaction or arrangement proposed involving the possible conflict of interest.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Chair of the Board of the Board shall, if deemed necessary and appropriate, appoint a disinterested person or committee to investigate alternatives to the proposed transaction  or arrangement. 
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>After exercising due diligence, the Board shall determine whether the Corporation/Organization can obtain with reasonable efforts a more advantageous transaction or arrangement from a person or entity that would not give rise to a conflict of interest.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>If a more advantageous transaction or arrangement is not reasonably possible under circumstances not producing a conflict of interest, the Board shall determine by a majority vote of the disinterested directors whether the transaction or arrangement is in the best interest of the Corporation/Organization, for its own benefit, and whether it is fair and reasonable. It shall make its decision as to whether to enter into the transaction arrangement in conformity with this determination.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Violations of Conflict of Interest Policy
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Should the Board have reasonable cause to believe an interested person has failed to disclose actual or possible conflicts of interest, the Board shall then inform the interested person of the basis for such belief and afford the interested person an opportunity to explain the alleged failure to disclose.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>If, after hearing the interested person's explanation, and after making further investigation as may be warranted in consideration of the circumstances, the Board determines the interested person intentionally failed to disclose an actual or possible conflict of interest, it shall take appropriate disciplinary and corrective action.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Procedures and Records
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>All minutes of the Board Meetings, when applicable, shall contain the following information:
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>The names of all the persons who disclosed or otherwise were found to have a financial interest in connection with an actual or possible conflict of interest, the nature of the financial interest, any action taken to determine whether a conflict of interest was present, and the Board's decision as to whether a conflict of interest in fact existed.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>The names of the persons who were present for discussions and any votes relating to the transaction or arrangement, the content of the discussions, including any alternatives to the proposed transaction or arrangement, and a record of any vote taken in connection with the proceedings.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Acknowledgement of Conflict of Interest Policy
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Each director, principal officer, and member of a committee with Board delegated powers shall be required to sign a statement which affirms that such person:
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Has received a copy of the conflict of interest policy;
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Has read and understands the policy;
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Has agreed to comply with the policy; and
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Understands that the Corporation/Organization is charitable, and in order to maintain its federal tax exemption, it must engage primarily in activities which accomplish one or more of its tax-exempt purposes.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Violation of Loyalty - Self-Dealing Contracts
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>A self-dealing contract is any contract or transaction (i) between this Corporation/Organization and one or more of its Directors, or between this Corporation/Organization and any corporation, firm, or association in which one or more of the Directors has a material financial interest ("Interested Director"), or (ii) between this Corporation/Organization and a corporation, firm, or association of which one or more of its directors are Directors of this Corporation/Organization. Said self-dealing shall not be void or voidable because such Director(s) of corporation, firm, or association are parties or because said Director(s) are present at the meeting of the Board of Directors or committee which authorizes, approves or ratifies the self-dealing contract, if:
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>All material facts are fully disclosed to or otherwise known by the members of the Board and the self-dealing contract is approved by the Interested Director in good faith (without including the vote of any membership owned by said interested Director(s));
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>All material facts are fully disclosed to or otherwise known by the Board of Directors or committee, and the Board of Directors or committee authorizes, approves, or ratifies the self-dealing contract in good faith—without counting the vote of the interest Director(s)— and the contract is just and reasonable as to the Corporation/Organization at the time it is authorized, approved, or ratified; or
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>As to contracts not approved as provided in above sections (a) and/or (b), the person asserting the validity of the self-dealing contract sustains the burden of proving that the contract was just and reasonable as to the Corporation/Organization at the time it was
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>authorized, approved, or ratified.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Interested Director(s) may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof, which authorizes, approves, or ratifies a contract or transaction as provided for and contained in this section.
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>Indemnification
</strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Corporation/Organization shall indemnify its "agents," as described by law, including its directors, officers, employees and volunteers, and including persons formerly occupying any such position, and their heirs, executors and administrators, against all expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with any "proceeding," and including any action by or in the right of the Corporation/Organization, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a person as described in the Non-Profit Corporation Act. Such right of indemnification shall not be deemed exclusive of any other right to which such persons may be entitled apart from this Article.&nbsp;</strong><br></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong><br></strong></div><div style="text-align: left;"><strong>The Corporation/Organization shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any agent of the Corporation/Organization, to the fullest extent permitted by law, against any liability asserted against or incurred by the agent in such capacity or arising out of the agent's status as such, or to give other indemnification to the extent permitted by law.
